Computer Vision (CV) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on enabling machines to interpret, analyze, and understand the visual world. It aims to replicate the human visual system's ability to perceive and comprehend visual information from digital images or videos.


Key Components of Computer Vision:
Image Acquisition: Computer vision systems acquire visual data from various sources, such as cameras, satellites, or medical imaging devices.

Pre-processing: Once images or videos are acquired, pre-processing techniques are applied to enhance the quality of the data and prepare it for further analysis. This may involve tasks like noise reduction, color correction, or resizing.

Feature Extraction: Computer vision algorithms extract meaningful features from the visual data to represent objects, shapes, textures, and patterns. Features can include edges, corners, color histograms, or more complex descriptors.

Object Detection and Recognition: Object detection involves locating and identifying objects within images or videos, while object recognition assigns semantic labels to detected objects. This enables systems to understand the content of visual data and recognize specific objects or categories.

Image Classification: Image classification assigns a label or category to an entire image based on its contents. This is often achieved using machine learning algorithms trained on labeled datasets.

Segmentation: Image segmentation divides an image into regions or segments based on shared characteristics, such as color, intensity, or texture. This is useful for tasks like scene understanding, medical image analysis, or autonomous navigation.

Tracking and Motion Analysis: Computer vision systems can track objects' movements over time and analyze motion patterns within videos. This is crucial for applications like surveillance, sports analytics, or robotics.

Depth Estimation: Depth estimation techniques infer the distance of objects from the camera, enabling systems to perceive the 3D structure of a scene. This is essential for tasks like augmented reality, autonomous driving, or robotics.
